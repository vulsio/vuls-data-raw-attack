	"description": "[HomeLand Justice](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0038) was a disruptive campaign involving the use of ransomware, wiper malware, and sensitive information leaks conducted by Iranian state cyber actors against Albanian government networks in July and September 2022. Initial access for [HomeLand Justice](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0038) was established in May 2021 as threat actors subsequently moved laterally, exfiltrated sensitive information, and maintained persistence for approximately 14 months prior to the attacks. Responsibility was claimed by the \"HomeLand Justice\" front whose messaging indicated targeting of the Mujahedeen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group who maintain a refugee camp in Albania, and were formerly designated a terrorist organization by the US State Department.(Citation: Mandiant ROADSWEEP August 2022)(Citation: Microsoft Albanian Government Attacks September 2022)(Citation: CISA Iran Albanian Attacks September 2022) A second wave of attacks was launched in September 2022 using similar tactics after public attribution of the previous activity to Iran and the severing of diplomatic ties between Iran and Albania.(Citation: CISA Iran Albanian Attacks September 2022)\n\n",
