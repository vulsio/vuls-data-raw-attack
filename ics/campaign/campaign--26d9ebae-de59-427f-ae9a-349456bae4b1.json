	"description": "[Frankenstein](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0001) was described by security researchers as a highly-targeted campaign conducted by moderately sophisticated and highly resourceful threat actors in early 2019. The unidentified actors primarily relied on open source tools, including [Empire](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363). The campaign name refers to the actors' ability to piece together several unrelated open-source tool components.(Citation: Talos Frankenstein June 2019)",
