	"description": "Monitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes. Utilization of the Windows APIs may involve processes loading/accessing system DLLs associated with providing called functions (ex: ntdll.dll, kernel32.dll, advapi32.dll, user32.dll, and gdi32.dll). Monitoring for DLL loads, especially to abnormal/unusual or potentially malicious processes, may indicate abuse of the Windows API. Though noisy, this data can be combined with other indicators to identify adversary activity.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Look for unusual or abnormal DLL loads, processes loading DLLs not typically associated with them\n\n<code>sourcetype=Sysmon EventCode=7\n| stats count by module_name process_name user\n| where module_name IN (\"ntdll.dll\", \"kernel32.dll\", \"advapi32.dll\", \"user32.dll\", \"gdi32.dll\") </code>",
