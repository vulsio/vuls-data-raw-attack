  "description": "Monitor for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. \n\nA remote desktop logon, through [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001), may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.\n\nMultiple users logged into a single machine at the same time, or even within the same hour, do not typically occur in networks we have observed.\nLogon events are Windows Event Code 4624 for Windows Vista and above, 518 for pre-Vista. Logoff events are 4634 for Windows Vista and above, 538 for pre-Vista. Logon types 2, 3, 9 and 10 are of interest. For more details see the Logon Types table on Microsoft’s Audit Logon Events page.\n\n<h4>Analytic 1 - Remote Desktop Logon</h4>\n<code>suspicious_netconn = filter network_connections where (event_id = “4624\" AND AuthenticationPackageName = 'Negotiate' AND Severity = \"Information\" AND logon_type = \"10\")</code>\n\n<h4>Analytic 2 - Simultaneous Logins on a Host</h4>\n<code>users_grouped = group users_list by hostname\nusers_grouped = from users_grouped select min(time) as earliest_time, max(time) as latest_time count(user) as user_count\nmultiple_logins = filter users_grouped where (latest_time - earliest_time <= 1 hour and user_count > 1)</code>",
