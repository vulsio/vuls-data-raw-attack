For example, available AD CS certificate templates can be checked via the Certificate Authority MMC snap-in (`certsrv.msc`). `certutil.exe` can also be used to examine various information within an AD CS CA database.(Citation: SpecterOps Certified Pre Owned)(Citation: GitHub PSPKIAudit)(Citation: GitHub Certify)",
