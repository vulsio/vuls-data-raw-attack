	"description": "Monitor for abnormal process creations, such as a Command and Scripting Interpreter spawning from a potentially exploited application. Also look for other behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of browser or Office processes.\n\nExample, it is not expected behavior for print spool service to be executing discovery type processes. However, this is one example and could be any number of native or third party processes that are executing either unusual or unknown (potentially adversary brought) processes.\n\nNote:\n- Analytic 1, look for instances where Office Applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) are launched with suspicious parameters or from unusual locations\n- Analytic 2, look for abnormal child process creation by Office Applications especially when accompanied by suspicious command-line parameters\n\nAnalytic 1 - Office Application Process Execution\n\n<code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") AND (Image= “\\winword.exe” OR Image= “\\excel.exe” OR Image= “*\\powerpnt.exe”) AND (CommandLine= “*macro*” OR CommandLine= “*automation*” OR CommandLine= “*shellcode*”) AND ParentCommandLine= “*open*”</code>\n\nAnalytic 2 - Unusual Child Process Creation\n\n<code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") AND (ParentImage= “\\winword.exe” OR ParentImage= “\\excel.exe” OR ParentImage= “\\powerpnt.exe”) AND (Image != “\\system32\\” OR Image != “*\\program files”)</code>",
