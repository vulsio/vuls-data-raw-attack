	"description": "In an attempt to avoid detection after compromising a machine, threat actors often try to disable Windows Defender. This is often done using “sc” [service control], a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft for managing services. This action interferes with event detection and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.\n\nNote: Though this analytic is utilizing Event ID 1 for process creation, the arguments are specifically looking for the use of service control for querying or trying to stop Windows Defender.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Detecting Tampering of Windows Defender Command Prompt\n\n<code>(source=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\sc.exe\" (CommandLine=\"sc *config*\" OR CommandLine=\"sc *stop*\" OR CommandLine=\"sc *query*\" )</code>",
