	"description": "Monitor for newly executed processes with arguments that may try to get information about registered services. System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). For event id 4688, depending on Windows version, you might need to enable <code> Administrative Templates\\System\\Audit Process Creation\\Include command line in process creation events </code> group policy to include command line in process creation events.\n\n<h4> Analytic 1 -  Suspicious Processes </h4>\n<code> suspicious_processes = filter processes where (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND\n  ((command_line LIKE '%sc%' AND command_line LIKE '%query%') OR \n   (command_line LIKE '%tasklist%' AND command_line LIKE '%/svc%') OR\n   (command_line LIKE '%systemctl%' AND command_line LIKE '%--type=service%') OR\n   (command_line LIKE '%net%' AND command_line LIKE '%start%')) </code>",
