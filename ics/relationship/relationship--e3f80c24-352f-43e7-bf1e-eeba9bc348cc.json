  "description": "Monitor for API calls (such as <code>GetForegroundWindow()</code>) that may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. <code>GetForegroundWindow</code> api returns a handle to the foreground window (the window with which the user is currently working). Other API calls relevant to Local Group discovery include <code> GetProcesses</code> and <code>GetForegroundWindow</code>. <code>GetProcesses</code> api returns an array of type Process that represents all the process resources running on the local computer.\n\nNote: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary. \n\n<h4> Analytic 1 - Suspicious API Calls</h4>\n<code> suspicious_apis = filter processes where ApiName LIKE '%GetProcesses%' OR ApiName LIKE '%GetForegroundWindow%'</code>",
