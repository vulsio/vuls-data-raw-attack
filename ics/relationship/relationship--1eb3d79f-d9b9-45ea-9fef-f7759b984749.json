Windows event logs may highlight activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (e.g., `Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted`).\n\nAlerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate account modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.",
