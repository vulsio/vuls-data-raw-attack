System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created).\n\n<h4> Analytic 1 - Suspicious Processes</h4>\n<code> suspicious_processes = filter process where \n  (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND\n  (command_line LIKE '%Get-Process%' AND command_line LIKE '%mainWindowTitle%')</code>",
