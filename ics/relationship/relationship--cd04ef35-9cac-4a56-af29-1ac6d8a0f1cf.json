  "description": "Monitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a process. Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image loaded) can be used to monitor the loading of DLLs into processes. This is a particularly noisy event and can generate a large volume of data, so we recommend baselining and filtering out any known benign processes and module loads to help reduce the number of events that are produced.",
