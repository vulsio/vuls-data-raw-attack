	"description": "The deletion of a new instance or virtual machine is a common part of operations within many cloud environments. Events should then not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities. For example, detecting a sequence of events such as the creation of an instance, mounting of a snapshot to that instance, and deletion of that instance by a new user account may indicate suspicious activity.\n\nIn AWS, CloudTrail logs capture the deletion of an instance in the TerminateInstances event, and in Azure the deletion of a VM may be captured in Azure activity logs.(Citation: AWS CloudTrail Search) (Citation: Azure Activity Logs) Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the usage of gcloud compute instances delete to delete a VM.(Citation: Cloud Audit Logs)\n\nAnalytic 1 - Operations performed by unexpected initiators, unusual resource names, frequent deletions\n\n<code>index=\"azure_activity_logs\" (OperationName=\"Delete Virtual Machine\" OR OperationName=\"Delete Disk\" OR OperationName=\"Delete Role Assignment\")\n| stats count by InitiatorName, Resource\n| where Resource LIKE \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines*\" AND (Status!=\"Succeeded\" OR InitiatorName!=\"expected_initiator\")\n| sort by Time </code>",
