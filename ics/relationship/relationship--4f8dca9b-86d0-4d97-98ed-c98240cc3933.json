(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft) (Citation: TechNet Least Privilege) Limit the usage of local administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries. \n\nFor example, audit the use of service accounts in Kubernetes, and avoid automatically granting them access to the Kubernetes API if this is not required.(Citation: Kubernetes Service Accounts) Implementing LAPS may also help prevent reuse of local administrator credentials across a domain.(Citation: Microsoft Remote Use of Local)",
