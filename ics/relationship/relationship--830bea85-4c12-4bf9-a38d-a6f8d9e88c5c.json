  "description": "Monitor cloud-based file hosting services, such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, for unusual instances of file downloads â€“ for example, many downloads by a single user in a short period of time. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies. Additionally, data loss prevention policies can be defined to detect and alert on exfiltration events on particularly sensitive data. ",
