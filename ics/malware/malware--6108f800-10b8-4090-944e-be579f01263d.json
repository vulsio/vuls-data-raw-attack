	"description": "[VPNFilter](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1010) is a multi-stage, modular platform with versatile capabilities to support both intelligence-collection and destructive cyber attack operations. [VPNFilter](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1010) modules such as its packet sniffer ('ps') can collect traffic that passes through an infected device, allowing the theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. (Citation: William Largent June 2018) (Citation: Carl Hurd March 2019) [VPNFilter](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1010) was assessed to be replaced by [Sandworm Team](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034) with [Cyclops Blink](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0687) starting in 2019.(Citation: NCSC CISA Cyclops Blink Advisory February 2022)",
