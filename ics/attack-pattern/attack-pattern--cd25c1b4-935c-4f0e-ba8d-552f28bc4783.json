	"description": "Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability. \n\nResource hijacking may take a number of different forms. For example, adversaries may:\n\n* Leverage compute resources in order to mine cryptocurrency\n* Sell network bandwidth to proxy networks\n* Generate SMS traffic for profit\n* Abuse cloud-based messaging services to send large quantities of spam messages\n\nIn some cases, adversaries may leverage multiple types of Resource Hijacking at once.(Citation: Sysdig Cryptojacking Proxyjacking 2023)",
