Discovered in August 2024, [VersaMem](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1154) was used during [Versa Director Zero Day Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0039) by [Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) to target ISPs and MSPs.  [VersaMem](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1154) is deployed as a Java Archive (JAR) and allows for credential capture for Versa Director logon activity as well as follow-on execution of arbitrary Java payloads.(Citation: Lumen Versa 2024)",
