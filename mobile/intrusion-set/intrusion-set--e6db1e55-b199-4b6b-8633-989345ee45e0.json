	"description": "[Moonstone Sleet](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1036) is a North Korean-linked threat actor executing both financially motivated attacks and espionage operations. The group previously overlapped significantly with another North Korean-linked entity, [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032), but has differentiated its tradecraft since 2023. [Moonstone Sleet](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1036) is notable for creating fake companies and personas to interact with victim entities, as well as developing unique malware such as a variant delivered via a fully functioning game.(Citation: Microsoft Moonstone Sleet 2024)",
