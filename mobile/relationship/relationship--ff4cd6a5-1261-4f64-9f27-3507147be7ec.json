  "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may abuse the Windows command shell for execution.\n\nNote: This Analytic works by creating a baseline of parent processes of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) seen over the last 30 days and a list of parent processes of [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) seen today. Parent processes in the baseline are removed from the set of parent processes seen today, leaving a list of new parent processes. This analytic attempts to identify suspicious programs spawning [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) by looking for programs that do not normally create [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106).  It is very common for some programs to spawn [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) as a subprocess, for example to run batch files or Windows commands. However, many processes don’t routinely launch a command prompt - e.g., Microsoft Outlook. A command prompt being launched from a process that normally doesn’t launch command prompts could be the result of malicious code being injected into that process, or of an attacker replacing a legitimate program with a malicious one.\n\n<h4>Analytic 1</h4>\n<code>cmd == filter processes where ((event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND exe == \"cmd.exe\")\ncmd == from cmd select parent_exe\nhistoric_cmd == filter cmd (where timestamp < now - 1 day AND timestamp > now - 1 day)\ncurrent_cmd == filter cmd (where timestamp >= now - 1 day)\nnew_cmd == historic_cmd - current_cmd </code>",
