Monitor for modification of account permissions in correlation with other suspicious activity. Changes may occur at unusual times or from unusual systems. Monitor for unusual permissions changes that may indicate excessively broad permissions being granted to compromised accounts or machine accounts being unexpectedly added into security groups. Monitor for accounts assigned to admin roles, such as Windows domain administrators, that go over a certain threshold of known admins. ",
