  "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. In an attempt to clear traces after compromising a machine, threat actors often try to clear Windows Event logs. This is often done using “wevtutil”, a legitimate tool provided by Microsoft. This action interferes with event collection and notification, and may lead to a security event going undetected, thereby potentially leading to further compromise of the network.\n\n<h4>Analytic 1 - Clearing Windows Logs with Wevtutil</h4>\n<code>cleared_logs = filter processes where (event_id = “1” AND process_name = “*wevtutil*” AND cmd_line= \"*cl*\" </code>",
