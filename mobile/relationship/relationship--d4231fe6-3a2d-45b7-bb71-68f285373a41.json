	"description": "Monitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines of \"wmic”. If the command line utility <code>wmic.exe</code> is used on the source host, then it can additionally be detected on an analytic. The command line on the source host is constructed into something like <code>wmic.exe /node:\"\\<hostname\\>\" process call create \"\\<command line\\>\"</code>. It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string <code>\"\\<hostname\\>\"</code> would instead look like IP Address. Processes can be created remotely via WMI in a few other ways, such as more direct API access or the built-in utility PowerShell.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process access) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). \n\nBesides executing arbitrary processes, wmic.exe can also be used to executed data stored in NTFS alternate data streams [NTFS File Attributes](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004).\nLooks for instances of wmic.exe as well as the substrings in the command line:\n- process call create\n- /node:\n\n<h4> Analytic 1 : Create Remote Process via WMIC</h4>\n<code> processes = filter processes where ((event_id=\"10\" OR event_id=\"4688\") AND exe == \"wmic.exe\" AND command_line == \"* process call create *\")</code>",
