	"description": "Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may leverage the CRM database as a source to mine valuable information. Monitor access to the CRM database, especially performed by privileged users as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of records; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies. ",
