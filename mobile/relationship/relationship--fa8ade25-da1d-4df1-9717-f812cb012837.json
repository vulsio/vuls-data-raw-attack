In Azure, limit the number of accounts with the roles Azure Virtual Machine Contributer and above, and consider using temporary Just-in-Time (JIT) roles to avoid permanently assigning privileged access to virtual machines.(Citation: Mandiant Azure Run Command 2021) In Azure AD, limit the number of Global and Intune administrators to only those required. In AWS, limit users with permission to execute the `ssm:SendCommand` action, and use tags to restrict the number of machines those users can execute commands on.(Citation: AWS Setting Up Run Command)",
