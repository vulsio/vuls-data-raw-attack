	"description": "Review authentication logs to ensure that mechanisms such as enforcement of MFA are functioning as intended.\n\nPeriodically review the hybrid identity solution in use for any discrepancies. For example, review all Pass Through Authentication (PTA) agents in the Azure Management Portal to identify any unwanted or unapproved ones.(Citation: Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors) If ADFS is in use, review DLLs and executable files in the AD FS and Global Assembly Cache directories to ensure that they are signed by Microsoft. Note that in some cases binaries may be catalog-signed, which may cause the file to appear unsigned when viewing file properties.(Citation: MagicWeb)\n\nPeriodically review for new and unknown network provider DLLs within the Registry (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\<NetworkProviderName>\\NetworkProvider\\ProviderPath`). Ensure only valid network provider DLLs are registered. The name of these can be found in the Registry key at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order`, and have corresponding service subkey pointing to a DLL at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentC ontrolSet\\Services\\<NetworkProviderName>\\NetworkProvider`.",
