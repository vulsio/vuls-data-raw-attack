	"description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a scripting environment included with Windows that is used by both attackers and administrators. Execution of PowerShell scripts in most Windows versions is opaque and not typically secured by antivirus which makes using PowerShell an easy way to circumvent security measures. This analytic detects execution of PowerShell scripts.\n\nPowershell can be used to hide monitored command line execution such as:\n\nnet use\nsc start\n\nNote: \n- The logic for Analytic 1 is based around detecting on non-interactive Powershell sessions (i.e., those not launched by a user through explorer.exe). This may lead to false positives when used in a production environment, so we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., looking for suspicious parent processes) that helps filter such events.\n- The logic for Analytic 2 is based around detecting on remote Powershell sessions. PowerShell can be used over WinRM to remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe executes wsmprovhost.exe.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Non-interactive Powershell Sessions\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") Image=\"powershell.exe\" AND ParentImage!=\"explorer.exe\"</code>\n\nAnalytic 2 - Remote Powershell Sessions \n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") Image=\"wsmprovhost.exe\" AND ParentImage=\"svchost.exe\"</code>\n\nAnalytic 3 - Powershell Execution\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\*\\\\powershell.exe\" ParentImage!=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\explorer.exe\"|stats values(CommandLine) as \"Command Lines\" values(ParentImage) as \"Parent Images\" by ComputerName</code>\n",
