	"description": "Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of regsvr32.exe. Compare recent invocations of regsvr32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). \n- Analytic 1 is a more generic analytic that looks for suspicious usage of regsvr32.exe, specifically for cases where regsvr32.exe creates child processes that aren’t itself. It’s not likely that this will result in millions of hits, but it does occur during benign activity so some form of baselining would be necessary for this to be useful as an alerting analytic.\n- Analytic 2 is around “Squiblydoo”, which is a specific usage of regsvr32.exe to load a COM scriptlet directly from the internet and execute it in a way that bypasses application whitelisting. It looks for regsvr32.exe process creation events that load scrobj.dll via the command-line (which executes the COM scriptlet).\n\n<h4> Analytic 1 - Generic Regsvr32 </h4>\n<code> processes = filter processes where (\n  (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND\n  parent_image_path == \"*regsvr32.exe\" and exe != \"*regsvr32.exe*\")</code>\n\n<h4>Analytic 2 - Squiblydoo</h4>\n<code>processes = filter process where (\n  (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND\n  (process_path == \"*regsvr32.exe\" and command_line == \"*scrobj.dll\"))</code>",
