	"description": "Often these third-party applications will have logs of their own that can be collected and correlated with other data from the environment. Ensure that third-party application logs are on-boarded to the enterprise logging system and the logs are regularly reviewed. Audit software deployment logs and look for suspicious or unauthorized activity. A system not typically used to push software to clients that suddenly is used for such a task outside of a known admin function may be suspicious. Monitor account login activity on these applications to detect suspicious/abnormal usage.\nPerform application deployment at regular times so that irregular deployment activity stands out.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Look for irregular deployment activity, systems not typically used for deployment suddenly pushing software, abnormal account login activity\n\n<code>sourcetype= aws_system_manager OR sourcetype=azure_arc | search (event_description=\"*deployment*\" OR action=\"*push*\" OR result=\"success\" OR result=\"failure\" OR command=\"run script\") </code>",
