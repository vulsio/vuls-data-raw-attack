	"description": "The creation of a new instance or VM is a common part of operations within many cloud environments. Events should then not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities. For example, the creation of an instance by a new user account or the unexpected creation of one or more snapshots followed by the creation of an instance may indicate suspicious activity.\n\nIn AWS, CloudTrail logs capture the creation of an instance in the RunInstances event, and in Azure the creation of a VM may be captured in Azure activity logs.(Citation: AWS CloudTrail Search) (Citation: Azure Activity Logs) Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the usage of gcloud compute instances create to create a VM.(Citation: Cloud Audit Logs)\n\nAnalytic 1 - Operations performed by unexpected initiators, unusual resource names, frequent modifications\n\n<code> index=\"azure_activity_logs\" (OperationName=\"Create or Update Virtual Machine\" OR OperationName=\"Create or Update Virtual Machine Extension\")\n| stats count by InitiatorName, Resource\n| where Resource LIKE \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines*\" AND (Status!=\"Succeeded\" OR InitiatorName!=\"expected_initiator\")\n| sort by Time</code> ",
