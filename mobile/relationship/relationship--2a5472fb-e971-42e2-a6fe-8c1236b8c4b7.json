  "description": "Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. In addition to network level detections, endpoint logging and instrumentation can be useful for detection. Attacks targeting web applications may generate logs in the web server, application server, and/or database server that can be used to identify the type of attack, possibly before the impact is felt. Externally monitor the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.",
