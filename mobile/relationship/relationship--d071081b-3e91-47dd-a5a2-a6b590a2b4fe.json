	"description": "Monitor cloud logs for API calls and other potentially unusual activity related to snapshot enumeration. Discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection and Exfiltration, based on the information obtained.",
