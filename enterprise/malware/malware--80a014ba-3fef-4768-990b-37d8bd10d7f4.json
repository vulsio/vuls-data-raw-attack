  "description": "[Uroburos](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0022) is a sophisticated cyber espionage tool written in C that has been used by units within Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) associated with the [Turla](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010) toolset to collect intelligence on sensitive targets worldwide. [Uroburos](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0022) has several variants and has undergone nearly constant upgrade since its initial development in 2003 to keep it viable after public disclosures. [Uroburos](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0022) is typically deployed to external-facing nodes on a targeted network and has the ability to leverage additional tools and TTPs to further exploit an internal network. [Uroburos](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0022) has interoperable implants for Windows, Linux, and macOS, employs a high level of stealth in communications and architecture, and can easily incorporate new or replacement components.(Citation: Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA23-129A Snake Malware May 2023)(Citation: Kaspersky Turla)",
