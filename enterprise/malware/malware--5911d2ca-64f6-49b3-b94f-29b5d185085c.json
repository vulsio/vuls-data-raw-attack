SocGholish is operated by [Mustard Tempest](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1020) and its access has been sold to groups including [Indrik Spider](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0119) for downloading secondary RAT and ransomware payloads.(Citation: SentinelOne SocGholish Infrastructure November 2022)(Citation: SocGholish-update)(Citation: Red Canary SocGholish March 2024)(Citation: Secureworks Gold Prelude Profile) ",
