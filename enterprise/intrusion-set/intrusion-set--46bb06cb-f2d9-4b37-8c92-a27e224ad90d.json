	"description": "[Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1024) is a ransomware variant and ransomware deployment entity active since at least March 2023.(Citation: Arctic Wolf Akira 2023) [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1024) uses compromised credentials to access single-factor external access mechanisms such as VPNs for initial access, then various publicly-available tools and techniques for lateral movement.(Citation: Arctic Wolf Akira 2023)(Citation: Secureworks GOLD SAHARA) [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1024) operations are associated with \"double extortion\" ransomware activity, where data is exfiltrated from victim environments prior to encryption, with threats to publish files if a ransom is not paid. Technical analysis of [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1129) ransomware indicates multiple overlaps with and similarities to [Conti](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575) malware.(Citation: BushidoToken Akira 2023)",
