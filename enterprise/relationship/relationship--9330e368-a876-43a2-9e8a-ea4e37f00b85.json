  "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic is oriented around looking for an invocation of either spoolsv.exe or conhost.exe by a user, thus alerting us of any potentially malicious activity. A common way of escalating privileges in a system is by externally invoking and exploiting these executables, both of which are legitimate Windows applications. \n\n<h4> Analytic 1 - Unusual Child Process for spoolsv.exe or connhost.exe </h4>\n<code> processes = filter processes where (\n  (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND\n  (exe ==\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spoolsv.exe\" OR \n   exe ==\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe\") AND\n   parent_image_path == \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\")</code>",
