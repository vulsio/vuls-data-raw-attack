	"description": "Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organization IP ranges.(Citation: Microsoft Common Conditional Access Policies) Consider blocking risky authentication requests, such as those originating from anonymizing services/proxies.(Citation: Okta Block Anonymizing Services)",
