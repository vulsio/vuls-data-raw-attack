	"description": "Monitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse the Windows command shell for execution. Usage of the Windows command shell may be common on administrator, developer, or power user systems depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempt to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Look for unusual command shell execution.\n\n<code> sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security\n| search (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=4689) process_name=\"cmd.exe\"\n| eval suspicious_cmd=if(like(command_line, \"%/c%\") OR like(command_line, \"%.bat%\") OR like(command_line, \"%.cmd%\"), \"Yes\", \"No\")\n| where suspicious_cmd=\"Yes\"</code>",
