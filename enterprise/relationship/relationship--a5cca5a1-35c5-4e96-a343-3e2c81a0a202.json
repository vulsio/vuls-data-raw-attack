For example, review all PTA agents in the Entra ID Management Portal to identify any unwanted or unapproved ones.(Citation: Mandiant Azure AD Backdoors) If ADFS is in use, review DLLs and executable files in the AD FS and Global Assembly Cache directories to ensure that they are signed by Microsoft. Note that in some cases binaries may be catalog-signed, which may cause the file to appear unsigned when viewing file properties.(Citation: MagicWeb)",
