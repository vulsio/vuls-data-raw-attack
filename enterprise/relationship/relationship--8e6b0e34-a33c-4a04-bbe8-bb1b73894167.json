  "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may be indicative of credential dumping. On Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, monitor Windows Logs for LSASS.exe creation to verify that LSASS started as a protected process.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for any instances of [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) being created, therefore implying the querying or creation of tasks. If this tools is commonly used in your environment (e.g., by system administrators) this may lead to false positives and this analytic will therefore require tuning. \n\n<h4> Analytic 1 - Suspicious Process Execution</h4>\n<code> processes = filter processes where (\n  (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND\n  exe == \"at.exe\") </code>",
