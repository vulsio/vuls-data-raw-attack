	"description": "Monitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.",
