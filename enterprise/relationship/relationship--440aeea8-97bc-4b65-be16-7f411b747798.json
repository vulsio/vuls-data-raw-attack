  "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process access) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). \n- The logic for Analytic 1 is based around detecting on non-interactive Powershell sessions (i.e., those not launched by a user through explorer.exe). This may lead to false positives when used in a production environment, so we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., looking for suspicious parent processes) that helps filter such events.\n- The logic for Analytic 2 is based around detecting on remote Powershell sessions. PowerShell can be used over WinRM to remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe executes wsmprovhost.exe.\n\n<h4>Analytic 1- Non-interactive Powershell Sessions</h4>\n<code>processes = filter process where ((event_id=\"10\" OR event_id=\"4688\") AND exe == \"powershell.exe\" AND parent_exe != \"explorer.exe\")</code>\n\n<h4>Analytic 2- Remote Powershell Sessions</h4>\n<code>processes = filter process where ((event_id=\"10\" OR event_id=\"4688\") AND exe == \"wsmprovhost.exe\" and parent_exe == \"svchost.exe\")</code>",
