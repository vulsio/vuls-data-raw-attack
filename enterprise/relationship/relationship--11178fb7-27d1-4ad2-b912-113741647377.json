	"description": "Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts, such as Sysmon Event 3 (Network connection) where Image contains CMSTP.exe and DestinationIP is external.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for the creation of a new CMSTP.exe process which initiates a network connection to a non-local IP address. This is a specific implementation where CMSTP.exe can be leveraged to setup listeners that will receive and install malware from remote sources in a trusted fashion.\n\nAnalytic 1 - CMSTP\n\n<code>(sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=\"3\") Image=\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\CMSTP.exe\" | WHERE ((!cidrmatch(\"10.0.0.0/8\", SourceIp) AND !cidrmatch(\"192.168.0.0/16\", SourceIp) AND !cidrmatch(\"172.16.0.0/12\", SourceIp))</code>",
