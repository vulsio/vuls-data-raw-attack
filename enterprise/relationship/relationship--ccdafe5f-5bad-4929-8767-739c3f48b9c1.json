  "description": "Monitor for newly executed processes that may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.\n\nNote: The New-PSDrive PowerShell cmdlet creates temporary and persistent drives that are mapped to or associated with a location in a data store, such a registry key (PSProvider “Registry”). The Get-ChildItem gets the items in one or more specified locations. By using both, you can enumerate COM objects in one or more specified locations.\n\nNote for Analytic 3: Replace FilePathToLolbasProcessXX.exe with lolBAS process names that are used by your organization. The number_standard_deviations parameter should be tuned accordingly. Identifying outliers by comparing distance from a data point to the average value against a certain number of standard deviations is recommended for data values that are symmetrical distributed. If your data is not distributed, try a different algorithm such as the Interquartile Range (IQR).\n\n<h4> Analytic 1 - Suspicious Processes with Registry keys </h4>\n<code>suspicious_processes = filter processes where (EventId == \"1\" OR EventId == \"4688\") AND((ProcessCommandLine LIKE '%reg%' AND ProcessCommandLine LIKE '%query%') OR (ProcessCommandLine LIKE '%Registry%' AND (ProcessCommandLine LIKE '%HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT%' OR ProcessCommandLine '%HKCR%'))) </code>\n    \n<h4> Analytic 2 - reg.exe spawned from suspicious cmd.exe </h4>\n<code>reg_processes = filter processes where (EventId == \"1\" OR EventId == \"4688\") AND (ProcessFilePath LIKE '%reg.exe%' AND ProcessParentFilePath LIKE '%cmd.exe%')\n\ncmd_processes = filter command_line where (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND (ProcessFilePath LIKE '%cmd.exe%' AND ProcessParentFilePath NOT LIKE '%explorer.exe%') \n\nsuspicious_processes = \nSELECT r.ProcessGuid, r.ProcessFilePath, c.ProcessFilePath AS ProcessParentFilePath\nFROM reg_processes r\nINNER JOIN cmd_processes c\nON r.ProcessParentGuid = c.ProcessGuid </code>\n\n<h4>Analytic 3 - Rare LolBAS command lines</h4>\n<code>count_lolbas_processes = filter processes where (EventId == \"1\" OR EventId == \"4688\") AND ProcessFilePath IN ('FilePathToLolbasProcess01.exe','FilePathToLolbasProcess02.exe')\nGROUP BY ProcessFilePath\n\nnumber_standard_deviations = 1.5\n\nsuspicious_processes = \nSELECT ProcessFilePath, ProcessCount, \n       AVG(ProcessCount) Over() - STDEV(ProcessCount) Over() * number_standard_deviations as LowerBound \nFROM count_lolbas_processes\nWHERE\n  ProcessCount < LowerBound </code>\n",
