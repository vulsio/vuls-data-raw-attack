Consider analyzing packet contents to detect application layer protocols, leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows(e.g. snmp traffic originating from unauthorized or untrusted hosts, signature detection for strings mapped to device configuration(s), and anomolies in snmp request(s))",
