	"description": "Monitor for files created in unusual directories or files with suspicious extensions. Focus on common locations like the Downloads folder, Temp directories, or the user’s Desktop, especially files that would be of interest from spearphishing attachments.\n\nWhile batch files are not inherently malicious, it is uncommon to see them created after OS installation, especially in the Windows directory. This analytic looks for the suspicious activity of a batch file being created within the C:\\Windows\\System32 directory tree. There will be only occasional false positives due to administrator actions.\n\nFor MacOS, utilities that work in concert with Apple’s Endpoint Security Framework such as File Monitor can be used to track file creation events.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Batch File Write to System32\n\n<code> (sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=\"11\") file_path=\"*system32*\" AND file_extension=\".bat\"</code>\n\nAnalytic 2 - New file creation in unusual directories.\n\n<code>sourcetype=WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational EventCode=11\n| search file_path IN (\"*/Downloads/*\", \"*/Temp/*\", \"*/Desktop/*\")\n| stats count by file_name file_extension file_path user\n| where file_extension IN (\"doc\", \"docx\", \"pdf\", \"xls\", \"rtf\", \"exe\", \"scr\", \"lnk\", \"pif\", \"cpl\", \"zip\") </code>",
