[DarkGate](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1111) will not execute its keylogging thread if a process name associated with Trend Micro anti-virus is identified, or if runtime checks identify the presence of Kaspersky anti-virus. [DarkGate](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1111) will initiate a new thread if certain security products are identified on the victim, and recreate any malicious files associated with it if it determines they were removed by security software in a new system location.(Citation: Ensilo Darkgate 2018)",
