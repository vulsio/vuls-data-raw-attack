	"description": "During [Cutting Edge](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0029), threat actors exploited CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances to enable authentication bypass and command injection. A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, CVE-2024-21893, was identified later and used to bypass mitigations for the initial two vulnerabilities by chaining with CVE-2024-21887.(Citation: Mandiant Cutting Edge January 2024)(Citation: Volexity Ivanti Zero-Day Exploitation January 2024)(Citation: Volexity Ivanti Global Exploitation January 2024)(Citation: Mandiant Cutting Edge Part 2 January 2024)(Citation: Mandiant Cutting Edge Part 3 February 2024)",
