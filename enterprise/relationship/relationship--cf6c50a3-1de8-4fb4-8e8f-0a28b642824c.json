	"description": "Monitor systems for abnormal Python usage and python.exe behavior, which could be an indicator of malicious activity. Understanding standard usage patterns is important to avoid a high number of false positives. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent. Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Look for unusual Python execution.\n\n<code>OR sourcetype=wineventlog:security OR sourcetype=sysmon\nEventCode=4688 OR EventCode=1 \n| search (process_name=\"python.exe\" OR process_name=\"python3\" OR process_name=\"python\")\n| eval suspicious_script=if(match(command_line, \".* -c .*|.*exec.*|.*import os.*|.*eval.*|.*base64.*\"), \"True\", \"False\")\n| where suspicious_script=\"True\"\n| table _time, user, host, command_line, process_name, parent_process\n </code> ",
