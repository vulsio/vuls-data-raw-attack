	"description": "During the [SolarWinds Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024), [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) used `scheduler` and `schtasks` to create new tasks on remote host as part of their lateral movement. They manipulated scheduled tasks by updating an existing legitimate task to execute their tools and then returned the scheduled task to its original configuration. [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) also created a scheduled task to maintain [SUNSPOT](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0562) persistence when the host booted.(Citation: Volexity SolarWinds)(Citation: FireEye SUNBURST Backdoor December 2020)(Citation: CrowdStrike SUNSPOT Implant January 2021)",
