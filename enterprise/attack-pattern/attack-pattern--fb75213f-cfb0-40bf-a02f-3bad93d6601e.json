	"description": "Adversaries may leverage chat and messaging applications, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and Slack, to mine valuable information.  \n\nThe following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on messaging applications: \n\n* Testing / development credentials (i.e., [Chat Messages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/008)) \n* Source code snippets \n* Links to network shares and other internal resources \n* Proprietary data(Citation: Guardian Grand Theft Auto Leak 2022)\n* Discussions about ongoing incident response efforts(Citation: SC Magazine Ragnar Locker 2021)(Citation: Microsoft DEV-0537)\n\nIn addition to exfiltrating data from messaging applications, adversaries may leverage data from chat messages in order to improve their targeting - for example, by learning more about an environment or evading ongoing incident response efforts.(Citation: Sentinel Labs NullBulge 2024)(Citation: Permiso Scattered Spider 2023)",
