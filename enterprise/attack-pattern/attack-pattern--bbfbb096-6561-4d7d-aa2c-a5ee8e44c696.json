	"description": "Adversaries may leverage Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to mine valuable information. CRM software is used to assist organizations in tracking and managing customer interactions, as well as storing customer data.\n\nOnce adversaries gain access to a victim organization, they may mine CRM software for customer data. This may include personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses, as well as additional details such as purchase histories and IT support interactions. By collecting this data, an adversary may be able to send personalized [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) emails, engage in SIM swapping, or otherwise target the organizationâ€™s customers in ways that enable financial gain or the compromise of additional organizations.(Citation: Bleeping Computer US Cellular Hack 2022)(Citation: Bleeping Computer Mint Mobile Hack 2021)(Citation: Bleeping Computer Bank Hack 2020)\n\nCRM software may be hosted on-premises or in the cloud. Information stored in these solutions may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Examples of CRM software include Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Zoho, Zendesk, and HubSpot.",
